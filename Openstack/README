Openstack Apply patch script will apply patches related to RPCore
to Openstack.

Script will ask user to confirm the dist-package for python.

Script will check the version of installed openstack over the machine
and then check if it has the patches for currently installed version.

If not, the script will exit.

Otherwise, it will apply the patch for provided argument.

Current version of script applies patch only to compute node, no patches are 
required for controller node.

One can also revert the patched applied by providing a --revert option

e.g :
Following will apply the patches for compute node
	bash ./Openstack_applyPatches.sh

Following will revert the patches for compute node
	bash ./Openstack_applyPatches.sh --revert
